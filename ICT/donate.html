     <p id="text-title">The season of giving is upon us once again and it's time to jump back into the hustle and bustle of the holidays. The gift of giving is a wonderful feeling. It’s a happy moment seeing the smile on your loved one’s face as they open each gift you’ve picked out just for them. However, this isn’t the only reason it’s good to give to charity. Studies show that giving has added health benefits for the charitable giver. Moreover, there are a variety of ways that those who give charitable donations can reap added (and surprising) health benefits while helping those in need.
