            <h2 id="title">What is meditation? </h2>
            <p id="text2">Meditation is a practice that involves focusing or clearing your mind using a combination of mental and physical techniques.</p>

            <p id="text2">Depending on the type of meditation you choose, you can meditate to relax, reduce anxiety and stress, and more. Some people even use meditation to help them improve their health, such as using it to help adapt to the challenges of quitting tobacco products.</p>
                
            <p id="text2">The practice of meditation is thousands of years old, and different forms come from around the world. But modern science has only started studying this practice in detail during the last few decades. Some of the biggest leaps in science's understanding of meditation have only been possible thanks to modern technology.</p>
                
            <p id="text2">On the outside, someone who's meditating might not seem to be doing anything other than breathing or repeating a sound or phrase over and over. Inside their brain, however, it's an entirely different story. Modern diagnostic and imaging techniques, like electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, show that meditation can positively affect your brain and mental health.</p>

            <h2 id="title">How do I start daily meditation? </h2>
            <p id="text2">With so many different types of meditation to choose from, it can feel daunting to know which one you're going to like best or will be most helpful for you. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to narrow it down.</p>

            <p id="text2"><b>Research.</b> Learning about the different types of meditation is a good first step to choosing one. You can do that research in books from a local library or bookstore or online from many sources. Cleveland Clinic's Health Essentials page has dozens of articles that can offer tips, information and other resources to help you choose.</p>
                
            <p id="text2"><b>Talk to your healthcare provider.</b> Your primary care provider or a mental health provider are both great sources of information on meditation. They can help you find meditation programs and instructors in your area.</p>
                
            <p id="text2"><b>Ask for guidance.</b> Whether it's from people you know or people with similar interests online, plenty of people know about and practice meditation. If you don't know anyone directly, websites and social platforms like YouTube or Reddit may be a good place to start. There are even smartphone apps that can help you meditate.</p>
