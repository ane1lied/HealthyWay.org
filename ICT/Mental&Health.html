            <h3>What is mental health?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. 
                    It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important
                    at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p>

            <h3>Why is mental health important for overall health?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.  
                    For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting 
                    conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase 
                    the risk for mental illness.</p>

            <h3>Can your mental health change over time?</h3>
            <img class="floatRightImg" src="mental3.jpg" width="200px" alt="health">
            <div>
                <p>Yes, it's important to remember that a person's mental health can change over time, depending on many factors.  When 
                    the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted. For example, if someone is working long hours, 
                    caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health.</p>
